          BEDTools         
==============================

Note
-------
Stable release for bedtools were formerly archived on Google Code. Unfortunately, Google Code
is shutting down so henceforth, all source code and stable releases will be maintained via this
Github repository.

Summary
-------
Collectively, the bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. The most widely-used tools enable genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.

While each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted by combining multiple bedtools operations on the UNIX command line.
