===Example Usage===  

	intersectBed.  Reports overlaps between features in two BED files.
	
	NOTE:  When intersecting SNPs, make sure the coordinate conform to the UCSC format.  That is,
		   the start position for each SNP should be SNP position - 1 and the end position should
		   be SNP position.  E.g. chr7	10000001	10000002	rs123464
		
			1. Report the base-pair overlap between the features in two BED files.
			$ intersectBed -a reads.bed -b genes.bed
			
			2. Report whether each entry in A overlaps ANY entry in B.
			$ intersectBed -a reads.bed -b genes.bed -u
			
			3. Report those entries in A that overlap NO entries in B.  Like "grep -v"
			$ intersectBed -a reads.bed -b genes.bed -v
			
			4. Report the count of entries in B that A overlaps.
			$ intersectBed -a reads.bed -b genes.bed -c
			
			5. Report the entire, original A entry for each overlap with B.
			$ intersectBed -a reads.bed -b genes.bed -wa
			
			6. Report the entire, original B entry for each overlap.
			$ intersectBed -a reads.bed -b genes.bed -wb
			
			7. Read BED A from stdin.  Useful for stringing together commands.  
			NOTE: -a must be "stdin".
			
			For example, find genes that overlap LINEs but not SINEs.
			$ intersectBed -a genes.bed -b LINES.bed | intersectBed -a stdin -b SINEs.bed -v


	peIntersectBed.  Reports overlaps between features in a "paired-end" BEDPE file and a regular BED feature file.
	
	OVERLAPS WITH PAIRED-END "ENDS"
			1. Which paired-end reads overlap with a repeat on EITHER end?
			$ peIntersectBed -a reads.bedpe -b repeatMasked.bed -type either
			
			2. Which structural variations overlap with a repeat on BOTH ends?
			$ peIntersectBed -a reads.bedpe -b repeatMasked.bed -type both

			3. Which paired-end reads DO NOT overlap with a repeat on either end?
			$ peIntersectBed -a reads.bedpe -b repeatMasked.bed -type NEITHER

			4. Which structural variations overlap with a repeat on ONE and ONLY ONE end?
			$ peIntersectBed -a reads.bedpe -b repeatMasked.bed -type xor
			
	OVERLAPS WITH THE "SPAN" OF THE PAIRED-END READ OR EVENT
			1. Which pair-end reads overlap span a gap based on the "inner-span"?			
			E.g.   Pair	=====....................=====
				   Gap			0000000000000000
			
			$ peIntersectBed -a reads.bedpe -b gaps.bed -type inspan
			
			
			2. Which pair-end reads overlap span a gene based on the "inner-span"?			
			E.g.   Pair	=====....................=====
				   Gene		00000000000000000000000
			
			$ peIntersectBed -a reads.bedpe -b genes.bed -type outspan
			


	closestBed. Very similar to intersectBed, but finds the closest (not necessarily overlapping) feature in B to each feature in A.
				If multiple features in B overlap a feature in A, the one with the highest overlap with respect to A is reported. 

			1. Find the closest ALU to each gene.
			$ closestBed -a genes.bed -b ALUs.bed 

			Allows input from stdin in the same manner as intersectBed (see #7).


	subtractBed. For each feature in A, it returns the fraction of that feature that is not overlapped by B.  If a feature in A is entirely
				"spanned" by any feature in B, it will not be reported.

			1. Remove introns from genes.
			$ subtractBed -a genes.bed -b introns.bed 

			Allows input from stdin in the same manner as intersectBed (see #7).


	windowBed.  Very similar to intersectBed, but allows one to look for overlaps within a window flanking each A entry
	
			1. Report all genes that are within 10000 bp UPSTREAM and DOWNSTREAM of CNVs.
			$ windowBed -a CNVs.bed -b genes.bed -w 10000
			
			Allows input from stdin in the same manner as intersectBed (see #7).

						
	mergeBed.  Merges overlapping or "book-ended" entries into a single entry.

			1. Merge overlapping repetitive elements into a single entry
			$ mergeBed -i repeatMasker.bed 
			
			2. Merge overlapping repetitive elements into a single entry, returning the number of entries merged
			$ mergeBed -i repeatMasker.bed -n
			
			3. Merge _nearby_ repetitive elements into a single entry, so long as they are within 1000 bp of one another
			$ mergeBed -i repeatMasker.bed -d 1000


	fastaFromBed.  Extracts sequences in FASTA format based for each of the intervals defined in a BED file.

			The headers in the input FASTA file must exactly match the chrom column (column 1) in the BED file. 
			If a strand is provided, the sequence will be reported accordingly (i.e. "-" returns a reverse complement). 
			Otherwise, everything is reported on the "+" strand.

			1. The example below will report those intervals in the human genome that do not contain an annotated repeat.
			$ fastaFromBed -db hg18.fa -bed segDups.hg18.bed -fo segDups.hg18.fasta
			
		
	sortBed.  Sort a BED file in ascending order, first by chrom, then by start position.
	
			$ sortBed scrambled.bed
			
			Accepts input from stdin:
			
			$ cat scrambled.bed | sortBed -i stdin > sorted.bed
		

	linksBed.  Creates HTML links from a BED file.

			$ linksBed myRegions.bed > myRegions.html 

			

	coverageBed. Reports the number of entries in A that overlap with each feature in B. For example, one could use 
				 BED B as say 10Kb "windows" across a genome. If BED A contained the coordinates of sequence alignments, 
				 one could use coverageBed to count the number of reads that map to each window. This would be a preliminary step
				 copy-number analysis. 
				 The output is in BEDGRAPH format and will allow you to plot the result on the UCSC Genome Browser.

			1. For example, column four is the number of reads in "A" that overlapped each "window" in "B" :

			$ coverageBed -a illuminaReads.bed -b windows.bed | head 
			chr1    0       10000   0
			chr1    10001   20000   33
			chr1    20001   30000   42
			chr1    30001   40000   71
	
	
	
	genomeCoverageBed. Computes a histogram of sequence coverage (aligned sequences in BED format) for a given genome. 
					   Optionally, (-d) it will also report the depth of coverage at each base on each chromosome in the 
					   genome file (-g) supplied. The (-max) option will "lump" all positions with a depth >= max 
					   into a single bin. I thank Royden Clark for his help in developing the speedy algorithm to compute coverage.
					
			By default, the output format is chrom, depth, number of bases at that depth, size of chrom, fraction of 
			bases at depth. 
			
			1. For example, here's a look at "Joe's genome" coverage on chromosome 1, binning everything with a depth >= 10 together:

			$ genomeCoverageBed -g hg18.genome -i joe.bed -max 10 | grep -P "chr1\t"
			chr1    0       88757187        247249719       0.358978
			chr1    1       26410800        247249719       0.106818
			chr1    2       21892230        247249719       0.088543
			chr1    3       18653191        247249719       0.0754427
			chr1    4       16000409        247249719       0.0647136
			chr1    5       13564576        247249719       0.0548618
			chr1    6       11582171        247249719       0.046844
			chr1    7       9722031         247249719       0.0393207
			chr1    8       8168742         247249719       0.0330384
			chr1    9       6765343         247249719       0.0273624
			chr1    10      25733039        247249719       0.104077
					
			
	
	complementBed.  Returns those intervals in a given genome that do not overlap the entries in a BED file.
	
			For example, report all intervals in the human genome that are not covered by repetitive elements.
			$ complementBed -i repeatMasker.bed -g hg18.genome
			
			That is:
			RepeatMasker:   	============		====			===========				========
			Output:			****            ********    ************           *************        *******
			
			NOTE:	Genome files must contain a single line for each chromosome in the following tab-delimited format.  
					
					If you wish to create a genome file for a different species, you can easily do this by using the UCSC 
					Genome Browser's MySQL interface or use the Table Browser (table chromInfo). Here's an example for how 
					to collect the genome info for hg18.
					
					 mysql --user=genome --host=genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu -A 
					 -e "select chrom, size from hg18.chromInfo"  > hg18.genome

					NOTE: Be sure to remove the header line (chrom size) in the resulting file prior to running genomeCoverageBed
					
					For example, here is hg18.genome.
