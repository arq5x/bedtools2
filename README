===Summary===  
BEDTools, prosaic as it may be, is a collection of utilities for comparing and 
intersecting genomic features in the UCSC Genome Browser BED format. 


===Acknowledgments=== 
1.  Jim Kent, UCSC.  
Much of the code herein is taken from Jim Kent's BED processing code.  
I am grateful for his elegant genome binning algorithm and therefore use it extensively.

2.  Michael Stromberg, Boston College.
I learned much of what I know about C++ style from Michael Stromberg.  I was formerly a C and Perl 
programmer and struggled to switch to C++.  The structure of BEDTools and much of the coding style
emulates Michael's.  Thanks Mike.

3.  Galaxy.  
I had been using Galaxy for months prior to writing these tools.  Much of the functionality is based on what is
available on the Galaxy website.  I merely found it too slow to do several iterations of queries on a website,
especially with large sequencing datasets.  Regardless, I am grateful to the Galaxy team for creating such a
useful site that is rapidly approaching ubiquity.

4.  Ira Hall.
Discussion between Ira and I are largely the motivation for these tools.  We are frequently tracking 
down impromptu ideas and these tools were largely designed to facilitate tangents.


===Installation===
1.  If you are reading this, you successfully downloaded and unzipped/unpacked the source tarball.  Great.
2.  Type "make all" at the command line.
3.  If you encountered no errors, then all of the BED Tools should now be in bin/
	If not, try to troubleshoot then email me: aaronquinlan@gmail.com
4.  Copy the files in bin/ to ~/bin or if you have the privileges, to /usr/local/bin.
5.  Use the tools.


===Requests===
I would be grateful to learn of any problems or suggestions you have for improving these tools.
